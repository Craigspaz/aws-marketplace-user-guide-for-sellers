## Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace<a name="standard-contracts"></a>



AWS Marketplace developed the [Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace \(SCMP\)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/Standard+Contract+for+AWS+Marketplace+2019-04-24.pdf) in collaboration with the buyer and seller communities\. The SCMP governs usage and defines the obligations of buyers and sellers for digital solutions\. Examples of digital solutions include server software, software as a service \(SaaS\), and artificial intelligence and machine learning \(AI/ML\) algorithms\)\.

The SCMP proactively defines common ground across key contractual clauses like use, warranty, indemnification, and governing law\. Sellers can offer SCMP terms as the EULA for self\-service transactions, where buyers can search for, buy, and quickly deploy solutions\. For [private offers](private-offers-overview.md), buyers can request the SCMP template from the seller, and the terms can be amended to address custom transaction requirements as agreed upon by the parties\.

You can also use the following optional addendums with the SCMP for self\-service or private offers:
+ [Enhanced Security Addendum ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/ESA+for+ECMP_SCMP+(Final+6-10-19).pdf) – Supports transactions with elevated data security requirements\.
+ [HIPAA Business Associate Addendum ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/HIPAA+BAA+for+SCMP_ECMP+(Final+6-10-19).pdf) – Supports transactions with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \(HIPAA\) compliance requirements\.

**Disclaimer**  
The EULA is between you and the buyer\. Using the SCMP as your EULA is at your discretion\. By applying the SCMP to your product listing, you are opting in to the SCMP program\. Under this program, AWS may update the SCMP template periodically and may update product listings carrying the terms with the current version\. You may withdraw from the SCMP program at any time by replacing the SCMP template with your own EULA\.

## Reseller Contract for AWS Marketplace<a name="reseller-contract-for-aws-marketplace"></a>

The Reseller Contract for AWS Marketplace \(RCMP\) is a standardized reseller contract template that ISVs can use when authorizing consulting partners to resell ISV products to AWS Marketplace buyers\. The contract helps reduce redundancy in legal contract reviews and accelerates time to market when ISVs and consulting partners enter into a reseller relationship and/or use the reseller terms for their [consulting partner private offer \(CPPO\)](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/features/cpprivateoffers)\. When creating a CPPO, ISVs can upload the contract to the opportunity \(Resale Authorization\), and then consulting partners can view and accept the contract\. AWS Marketplace buyers can't view the RCMP\.

**Disclaimer**  
The RCMP is an optional contract for ISVs\. If ISVs decide to resell their product through a consulting partner, they can either attach the RCMP or their own customized contract terms—existing or pre\-negotiated—when creating an opportunity\.
