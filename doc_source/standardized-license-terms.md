# Standardized contracts in AWS Marketplace<a name="standardized-license-terms"></a>

As you [prepare your product](product-preparation.md), you need to determine which end user license agreement \(EULA\) will govern the use of your product\. You can either apply your own EULA or use the standardized contract that AWS Marketplace offers to help streamline procurement workflows and speed transactions\.

AWS Marketplace developed the [Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace \(SCMP\)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/Standard+Contract+for+AWS+Marketplace+2019-04-24.pdf) in collaboration with the buyer and seller communities to govern usage and define the obligations of buyers and sellers for digital solutions\. Examples of digital solutions include server software, software as a service \(SaaS\), and artificial intelligence and machine learning \(AI/ML\) algorithms\.

You can also use the following optional addendums with the SCMP for self\-service or private offers:
+ [Enhanced Security Addendum ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/ESA+for+ECMP_SCMP+(Final+6-10-19).pdf) – Supports transactions with elevated data security requirements\.
+ [HIPPA Business Associate Addendum ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/HIPAA+BAA+for+SCMP_ECMP+(Final+6-10-19).pdf) – Supports transactions with HIPPA compliance requirements\.

**Disclaimer**  
The EULA is between you and the buyer\. Using the SCMP as your EULA is at your discretion\. By applying the SCMP to your product listing, you are opting in to the SCMP program\. Under this program, AWS may update the SCMP template periodically and may update product listings carrying the terms with the current version\. You may withdraw from the SCMP program at any time by replacing the SCMP template with your own EULA\.

## Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace<a name="standard-contracts"></a>

SCMP is a standardized contract template that governs usage and defines the obligations of buyers and sellers for digital solutions \(for example, server software, SaaS, and artificial intelligence and machine learning \(AI/ML\) algorithms\)\. The SCMP proactively defines common ground across key contractual clauses like use, warranty, indemnification, and governing law\. Sellers can offer SCMP terms as the EULA for self\-service transactions, where buyers can search for, buy, and quickly deploy solutions\. For [private offers](private-offers-overview.md), buyers can request the SCMP template from the seller, and the terms can be amended to address custom transaction requirements as agreed upon by the parties\.
