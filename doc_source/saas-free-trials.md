# SaaS free trials<a name="saas-free-trials"></a>

Sellers can create software as a service \(SaaS\) free trial offers in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal \(AMMP\)\. Customers can evaluate software products before making large purchase decisions by using the SaaS free trial option\. After a customer subscribes to your product, your product performs entitlement checks the same way it does for paid customers\.

Each AWS account can only use a free trial for a SaaS product once\. The free usage amount granted during a free trial is not shared across linked accounts in an AWS organization\. Different linked accounts within a single main payer account can create their own individual free trials\.

**Note**  
If you use Seller Data Delivery Service \(SDDS\), you'll receive an [Agreement details trial report](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/supplementary-reports.html) in your Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) bucket\. The report includes agreement details such as the subscriber name and ID, offer ID, and agreement start and end dates\. As a seller, you'll also receive [Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-notification.html) when new subscriptions are created\. Amazon SNS notifications include an `isFreeTrialTermPresent` flag to identify free trial agreements\.
