# Professional services products<a name="proserv-products"></a>

 As a seller, you can offer professional services to AWS Marketplace buyers\. Professional services include services to assess, migrate, support, manage, and train others in how to use AWS services and products in AWS Marketplace\. Sellers create a product offering that describes the services they provide, negotiate with customers to create an agreement on terms, and then create a custom offer for services through AWS Marketplace\. 

Buyers can find professional services products on the AWS Marketplace catalog by selecting **Professional Services** under **Categories**, choosing **Professional Services** under **Delivery methods**, and refine their search by **Publisher**, **Pricing model**, and **Pricing unit**\. They're charged for the services in their AWS bill\. They can use tools such as AWS Cost Explorer to centralize payments and manage their costs\.
