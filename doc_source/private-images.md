You can use private image builds to let buyers purchase your installable software products through AWS Marketplace, and then install those products on a gold image or Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) they choose from the images available to their AWS account\. A *gold image* is a buyer\-provided server image that includes a base operating system with modifications applied to help ensure the software adheres to the buyerâ€™s IT standards\. Gold images allow buyers to better meet their internal security, compliance, and management requirements\. 

If you have questions about private image builds, contact the [Marketplace Seller Operations Team](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.
