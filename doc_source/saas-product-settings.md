+ [Updating the allowlist of AWS account IDs](#update-allowlist)

## Creating a change request<a name="create-change-request.title"></a>

In a self\-service listing, you use a *change request* to make changes to your product\. Your requests can be found on the AWS Marketplace Management Portal on the [**Requests** tab](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/requests)\. You can make new requests through the **Request changes** dropdown list that is located under the navigation bar\.

**To create a change request for a SaaS product**

1. Open the AWS Marketplace Management Portal at [https://aws\.amazon\.com/marketplace/management/tour/](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/tour/) and sign in to your seller account\.

1. From the **Products** tab, select **SaaS** from the dropdown list\.

1. After the request is submitted, it begins processing\. The change request goes through the following statuses: **Under review**, **Preparing changes**, and **Applying changes**\.

1. When the request is completed, its status changes to one of the following values: 
   + **Succeeded** – This status indicates that your requested change was processed and changes are reflected in the system\.
   + **Failed** – This status indicates that something went wrong with the request and the changes were not processed\. If the status is **Failed**, you can select the request to find **Error Codes** that provide recommendations on how to correct the issue\. You can troubleshoot the errors and create a new request for the change\. To make the process faster, you can use a **Copy to new request** function which copies the details of the **Failed** request\. You can make needed changes and resubmit the request\.
