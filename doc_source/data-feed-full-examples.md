# Data feed query examples<a name="data-feed-full-examples"></a>

This section gives examples of complex queries using the data feeds provided by AWS Marketplace\. These examples are similar to the [Seller reports](Reporting.md) that you get from the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\. You can customize these queries to create other reports that you need\.

## Example 1: Disbursements by product<a name="data-feed-example-disbursement-by-product"></a>

To find out the amount that's been disbursed by product, you can run a query like the following\. This example is comparable to the [Disbursement report](monthly-disbursement-report.md) that you can get as a seller report\. However, you can use this sample to build your own queries and customize it to get exactly the report that you need\.

This set of sample queries build upon each other to create the final list of product details with disbursements\. It also shows how to get the product information at a specific point in time\. The comments in the queries explain what the queries are doing, as well as how you can modify them to get different views of the data\.

**Note**  
When running this query, we are assuming that the data ingested is using two time axes \(the valid\_from column and the update column\)\. For more details, see [Storage and structure of data feeds](data-feed-service.md#data-feed-details)\.
