# Integrate your SaaS contract product<a name="saas-integrate-contract"></a>

Integrating your product with AWS Marketplace is one step in [Creating a SaaS product](saas-create-product.md)\. To integrate your software as a service \(SaaS\) contract product with AWS Marketplace, you must write code and demonstrate that it can respond successfully to several customer scenarios\. The following sections describe these scenarios, how to respond to them, and provide an overview of testing your integration\.

**Note**  
Before you begin, make sure you've chosen the right pricing model for your software as a service \(SaaS\) product in AWS Marketplace\. For more information, see [Plan your SaaS product](saas-prepare.md)\.

+ [Scenario: Your service handles customer requests](#saas-contract-customer-requests)
+ [Scenario: Monitor changes to user subscriptions](#saas-contract-monitor-changes)
+ [Testing your SaaS contract product integration](#saas-contract-integration-testing)

## Scenario: Your service validates new customers<a name="saas-contract-validate-customer"></a>

When a customer subscribes to your product, they are redirected to your registration URL, which is an HTTP POST request with a temporary `x-amzn-marketplace-token` token\. Respond to this request in the following ways:

1. Exchange the token for a `CustomerIdentifier`, `CustomerAWSAccountId`, and `ProductCode` by calling the `[ ResolveCustomer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplacemetering/latest/APIReference/API_ResolveCustomer.html)` API operation in the AWS Marketplace Metering Service**\.

1. Verify the subscription and quantity \(if applicable\) the customer has access to by calling the `[ GetEntitlements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplaceentitlement/latest/APIReference/API_GetEntitlements.html)` API operation in the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service\.

1. Persist the `CustomerIdentifier`, `CustomerAWSAccountId`, and `ProductCode` in your system for future calls\. Store whether the customer has a valid subscription, along with whatever information you need about the customer\.

1. As a response to the request, you must show your user's first use experience \(as applicable for your service\)\.

## Scenario: Your service handles customer requests<a name="saas-contract-customer-requests"></a>

When a customer makes a request to your service, you must respond to the following scenarios with appropriate actions or messaging:
+ They don't have a customer ID in your system\. This means that they have not yet subscribed\. You should tell the user how to subscribe\.
+ They have a customer ID, and the `GetEntitlements` API operation returns an appropriate entitlement\. In this scenario, you should fulfill the request\.
+ They do have a customer ID, but the `GetEntitlements` API operation returns no entitlement, or not enough quantity to fulfill the request\. In this scenario, you must determine how to handle access and manage their experience\.

## Scenario: Monitor changes to user subscriptions<a name="saas-contract-monitor-changes"></a>

Set up an Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) queue, and subscribe to your product's Amazon SNS topic\. Your SNS topic information was included in the email message that you received from the AWS Marketplace Operations Team when you created your product\. For more information, see [Creating a SaaS product](saas-create-product.md)\. By subscribing to your SNS topic, you receive notifications about changes to customer entitlements, including providing or revoking access for specific customers\.

**Note**  
An SNS topic Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) looks like `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:<account id>:aws-mp-entitlement-notification-<product code>`\.

The only notification that you must respond to is:
+ `entitlement-updated` â€“ The customer entitlement has changed, and you must call the `GetEntitlements` API operation to see the new status\. Update your customer store, and, if applicable \(for example, the customer's contract has lapsed\), follow your practices for shutting down customer resources, adhering to your retention policies\.

**Note**  
For additional information, see [Checking entitlements](checking-entitlements.md)\.

## Testing your SaaS contract product integration<a name="saas-contract-integration-testing"></a>

After you've integrated your SaaS contract product with AWS Marketplace, you must conduct in\-depth testing to ensure that the integration is successful\. The following procedure outlines the steps to verify your product integration\.

**Note**  
Use your own accounts to subscribe to your product and test that the integration is successful\. Prices can be temporarily reduced so that you can test the purchase flow without incurring high charges in those accounts\. For more information about temporarily reducing the prices or allowing additional test accounts to access your product, [contact us](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.  
After your product is launched, the service must continue to respond to these scenarios for new customers\.

1. Use an allowed account to test the customer experience by getting a contract for your product\. 

1. After the account has the contract, ensure that the account is redirected to the registration URL, and that the redirect is a POST request that includes a temporary token\. Make sure that your application persists the customer ID for future calls and correctly handles the entitlement the customer has\. This tests part of [Scenario: Your service validates new customers](#saas-contract-validate-customer)\.

1. After verifying the test account in the previous step, onboard the account into your application\. For example, you can have the test customer fill out a form to create a new user account\. Or, provide them with other next steps to get access to your SaaS application\. This tests part of [Scenario: Your service validates new customers](#saas-contract-validate-customer)\.

1. If no entitlement is returned from the `GetEntitlements` API operation, either during onboarding or in your ongoing verification passes, your application must correctly manage access and the experience for users who are not entitled\. This tests [Scenario: Your service handles customer requests](#saas-contract-customer-requests)\.

1. Test for subscription changes\. Verify that your application correctly handles unsubscribes, successful subscription, and failed subscription scenarios\. This tests [Scenario: Monitor changes to user subscriptions](#saas-contract-monitor-changes)\.

1. After you have completed all the integration requirements and tested the solution, notify the AWS Marketplace Operations team\. They will then test the solution by verifying that you have successfully called the `GetEntitlements` API operation and sufficiently onboarded new customers\.

After your integration and testing is complete, you can perform a final review and list your product on the public AWS Marketplace\. For more information, see [Creating a SaaS product](saas-create-product.md)\. You can also cancel your test subscription by completing a Refund Request Form\. For more information on cancelling a subscription, see the [AWS Marketplace product refund process](refunds.md#refund-process)\.
