# Offer data feed<a name="data-feed-offer"></a>

The offer data feed provides information about all offers that you've created as the seller of record\. If a single offer has multiple revisions, all revisions are included in the data feed\.

When you make an offer revision and the data in an exposed field changes, a new record is created in the data feed for the same primary key \(`offer_id` plus `offer_revision`\)\. However, the `valid_from` field has a different value\. For more information about the data feed history columns, see [Historization of the data](data-feed.md#data-feed-historization)\.

The offer data feed is refreshed every 24 hours, so new data is available daily\.

The following table provides the names and descriptions of the data feed's columns\. 


| Column name  | Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
| offer\_id | The friendly identifier for the offer\.Can be used to join to the `offer_id` field of the `Offer_Product` data feed\. |
