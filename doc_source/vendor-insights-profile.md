# Viewing your AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights profile<a name="vendor-insights-profile"></a>

Your profile in AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights provides important information for buyers to use as they assess your product\. For data protection purposes, we recommend that you protect your AWS account credentials and set up individual user accounts with AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)\. That way each user is given only the permissions necessary to fulfill their job duties\. For more information about creating user accounts with IAM, refer to [AWS managed policies for AWS Marketplace sellers](security-iam-awsmanpol.md)\. 

Buyers can assess your product by using the AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights dashboard\. There, buyers can see a product overview that is defined by the data sources you add to your profile\. The security profile is defined by multiple security controls in 10 categories\. 

The 10 security categories used to define data are as follows:
+ Access management
+ Application security
+ Audit, compliance, and security policy
+ Business resiliency
+ Data security and privacy 
+ End user device and mobile security 
+ Human resources
+ Infrastructure security
+ Risk management and incident response
+ Security and configuration policy

For more information about control categories, refer to the *AWS Marketplace Buyer Guide*\.

By setting up and using AWS Marketplace Vendor Insights, you agree to comply with AWS service terms and data privacy rules to keep user information private and secure\. For more information about AWS data privacy terms, refer to the [Data Privacy FAQ](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/data-privacy-faq/)\. For more information about service terms, see [AWS service terms](http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)\.
