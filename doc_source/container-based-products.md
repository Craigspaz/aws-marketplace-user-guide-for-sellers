# Container\-based products<a name="container-based-products"></a>

AWS Marketplace supports software products that use Docker containers\. Container products consist of delivery options that are a set of container images and deployment templates that go together\. You submit at least one delivery option for your product, with up to a maximum of four\. For each delivery option, you provide a set of container images, usage instructions, and links to deployment templates for customers to launch that delivery option\.

AWS Marketplace buyers see the available delivery options on the published product detail pages that are available to them\. After they subscribe to the product and choose their preferred delivery option, buyers see information and instructions for launching and using the product\. For Container image delivery options, buyers see links to the available deployment templates and container image URLs\. They also receive instructions for how to pull the individual container images\. For Helm chart delivery options, buyers will see step\-by\-step instructions for launching using Helm\.

For a walkthrough of the buying experience, you can refer to this video: [ Deploying AWS Marketplace Containers on Amazon ECS Clusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaiUAiQQJtk) \(3:34\)\.

You can find, subscribe to, and deploy third\-party Kubernetes applications from AWS Marketplace on any Kubernetes cluster in any environment\. You can deploy third\-party Kubernetes applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service \(Amazon ECS\), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \(Amazon EKS\), AWS Fargate, and on\-premises using Amazon EKS Anywhere \(EKS Anywhere\)\. You can also deploy them on self\-managed Kubernetes clusters on\-premises or in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\)\.

You can run Free and Bring Your Own License model \(BYOL\) container products on any Docker\-compatible runtime\.
