# SaaS product pricing<a name="saas-pricing-models"></a>

After a buyer purchases your software as a service \(SaaS\) product on AWS Marketplace, AWS Marketplace provides you with their billing identiÔ¨Åer\. You use the billing identifier to call the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service and the AWS Marketplace Metering Service\. Then, customers access the product in your AWS environment or through a VPC endpoint connection you create\. 




**SaaS pricing models**  

| Pricing model | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| SaaS subscriptions | A pay\-as\-you\-go model where we bill buyers for their hourly usage of your SaaS product\. For more information, see [Pricing for SaaS subscriptions](saas-subscriptions.md) | 
| SaaS contracts | Buyers are either billed in advance for the use of your software, or you can offer them a flexible payment schedule\. Customers can also pay for additional usage above their contract\. For more information, see [Pricing for SaaS contracts](saas-contracts.md)\. | 
| SaaS contracts with pay\-as\-you\-go |  Buyers are either billed in advance for the use of your software, or you can offer them a flexible payment schedule\. Buyers are also billed an additional metered rate for usage on top of the contract price\. For more information, see [Pricing for SaaS contracts](saas-contracts.md)\. | 

To make your SaaS product available on AWS Marketplace, decide whether you want to offer the [SaaS subscriptions pricing model](saas-subscriptions.md) or the [SaaS contracts pricing model](saas-contracts.md)\.
