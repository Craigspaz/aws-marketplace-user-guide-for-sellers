# What is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, networking, storage, machine learning, business intelligence, and database\. Also available are related professional services to help you manage and support those solutions\. AWS Marketplace also simplifies software licensing and procurement with flexible pricing options and multiple deployment methods\. In addition, AWS Marketplace includes data products available from AWS Data Exchange\.

Customers can quickly launch preconfigured software, and choose software solutions in Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\), software as a service \(SaaS\), and other formats\. You can browse and find professional services related to the software\. You can browse and subscribe to data products\. Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi\-year, and Bring Your Own License model \(BYOL\), and get billed from one source\. AWS handles billing and payments, and charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\.

 You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer \(subscriber\), seller \(provider\), or both\. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer, and can register to become a seller\. A seller can be an independent software vendor \(ISV\), consulting partner, managed services provider \(MSP\), or individual who has something to offer that works with AWS products and services\. 

**Note**  
Data product providers must meet the AWS Data Exchange eligibility requirements\. For more information, see [Providing data products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

Every software product on AWS Marketplace has been through a curation process\. When the seller submits a product in AWS Marketplace, they define the price of the product and the terms and conditions of use\. On the product page, there can be one or more offerings for the product\. When a buyer subscribes to a product offering, they agree to the pricing and terms and conditions set for the offer\. 

 The product can be free to use, or it can have an associated charge\. The charge becomes part of the buyer's AWS bill, and after the buyer pays, AWS Marketplace pays the seller\. Products can take many forms\. For example, a product can be offered as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) that is instantiated using a buyer's AWS account\. The product can also be configured to use AWS CloudFormation templates for delivery to the buyer\. The product can also be SaaS offerings from an ISV, a web access control list \(web ACL\), set of rules, or conditions for AWS WAF\. The product could also be a professional service from an ISV, consulting partner, or MSP\.

Software products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement \(EULA\)\. In addition, software products can be offered with custom pricing and EULA through private offers\. Products can also be purchased under a contract with specified time or usage boundaries\. After subscribing to a product, the buyer can copy the product to their AWS Service Catalog to manage how the product is accessed and used in the buyer's organization\.
