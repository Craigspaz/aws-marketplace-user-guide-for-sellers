# What is AWS Marketplace?<a name="what-is-marketplace"></a>

AWS Marketplace is a curated digital catalog that customers can use to find, buy, deploy, and manage third\-party software, data, and services to build solutions and run their businesses\. AWS Marketplace includes thousands of software listings from popular categories such as security, business applications, machine learning, and data products across specific industries, such as healthcare, financial services, and telecommunications\. Customers can quickly launch preconfigured software, and choose software solutions in Amazon Machine Images \(AMIs\), software as a service \(SaaS\), and other formats\. Professional services are also available to help customers configure, deploy, and manage third\-party software\. For a complete list of delivery methods, see [Product delivery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/product-preparation.html#product-delivery)\. 

 You can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer \(subscriber\), seller \(provider\), or both\. Anyone with an AWS account can use AWS Marketplace as a buyer, and can register to become a seller\. A seller can be an independent software vendor \(ISV\), consulting partner, managed services provider \(MSP\), or individual who has something to offer that works with AWS products and services\. 

**Note**  
Data product providers must meet the AWS Data Exchange eligibility requirements\. For more information, see [Providing data products on AWS Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/latest/userguide/providing-data-sets.html) in the *AWS Data Exchange User Guide*\.

Eligible partners can programmatically list AWS Marketplace products outside of AWS Marketplace\. For more information about becoming an eligible partner, contact your AWS Marketplace business development partner\.

![\[Workflow diagram of the seller process\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/images/seller-process.png)


**Seller process**  

| Step | Action | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | [Register](seller-registration-process.md) | As a seller, you start by registering for the AWS Marketplace Management Portal \(AMMP\)\. We recommend that you implement a new dedicated AWS account that can be easily linked with an existing AWS organization\. Verify that the AWS Partner’s tax information meets the jurisdictional eligibility criteria\. For AWS Partners without an existing U\.S\. bank account, you can create one at no additional cost by using [Hyperwallet](https://wssellers.hyperwallet.com/hw2web/consumer/page/contact.xhtml)\.  | 
| 2 | Decide product type |  Decide on the type of product that you want to sell\. For more information about creating the product types in AWS Marketplace, see the following: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/what-is-marketplace.html)  | 
| 3 | [Prepare product](product-preparation.md) | Configure your package, set a pricing scheme, determine the relevant categories in which to list your product, and add keywords so your product appears in relevant searches\. To simplify the procurement process, you can use [standardized license terms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/standardized-license-terms.html) for both public product listings and private offers\.  | 
| 4 | [Submit product](product-submission.md) | Use the product submission process to make your products available on AWS Marketplace\. Products can be simple, for example, a single Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) that has one price structure\. Or, products can be complicated, with multiple AMIs, AWS CloudFormation templates, and complex pricing options and payment schedules\.  | 
| 5 | [Market product](product-marketing.md) | Contribute to the success of your product by driving awareness of AWS Marketplace and by driving traffic directly to your product pages on AWS Marketplace\.  | 
| 6 | [View reports and data feeds](reports-and-data-feed.md) | After you're registered as a seller, use the AWS Marketplace Management Portal to access usage reports for your products\. AWS Marketplace provides tools for collecting and analyzing information about your product sales\.  | 
| 7 | Manage products | Use the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) to manage your account and product pages\.  | 

 As a seller, go to the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) to register\. If you're charging for use of your product, you must also provide tax and banking information as part of your registration\. When you register, you create a profile for your company or for yourself that is discoverable on AWS Marketplace\. You also use the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) to create and manage product pages for your products\.



## Pricing<a name="pricing-overview"></a>

Products can be free to use or can have associated charges\. The charge becomes part of the buyer's AWS bill, and after the buyer pays, AWS pays the seller\. Products can take many forms\. For example, a product can be oﬀered as an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) that is instantiated using a buyer's AWS account\. Products can also be conﬁgured to use CloudFormation templates for delivery to the buyer\. Products can also be SaaS oﬀerings from an ISV, web access control lists \(web ACL\), sets of rules, or conditions for AWS WAF\. Products can also be professional services from an ISV, consulting partners, or MSP\.

Flexible pricing options include free trial, hourly, monthly, annual, multi\-year, and Bring Your Own License model \(BYOL\), and being billed from one source\. AWS handles billing and payments, and charges appear on customers’ AWS bill\. 

Software products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement \(EULA\)\. In addition, software products can be oﬀered with custom pricing and EULA through private oﬀers\. Products can also be purchased under a contract with speciﬁed time or usage boundaries\. After subscribing to a product, the buyer can copy the product to their AWS Service Catalog to manage how the product is accessed and used in the buyer's organization\.
