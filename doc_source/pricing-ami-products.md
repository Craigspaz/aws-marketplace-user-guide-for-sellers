# AMI product pricing<a name="pricing-ami-products"></a>

AWS Marketplace has multiple pricing models for Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) products\. With seller private oﬀers, there are options available for multi\-year and custom duration contracts\. 

For more information about multi\-year and custom duration contracts, see [Private offers](private-offers-overview.md) and [Flexible payment scheduler](flexible-payment-scheduler.md)\. The following table provides general information about pricing models\.

**Note**  
You must be able to provide a W\-9 tax form \(for US based entities\) or a W\-8 form \(for EU\-based entities\) as described in [Seller registration process](seller-registration-process.md)\.

## AMI pricing models<a name="pricing-models-for-ami-products"></a>

The following table provides general information about pricing models for AMI\-based products\.


|  Pricing model  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  Free  | Customers can run as many instances as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) supports with no additional software charges incurred\.  Free Trial and Annual pricing can't be combined with Monthly pricing\.  | 
| Bring your own license \(BYOL\)  | AWS Marketplace doesn't charge customers for usage of the software, but customers must supply a license key to activate the product\. This key is purchased outside of AWS Marketplace\. The entitlement and licensing enforcement, in addition to all pricing and billing, are handled by you\.  | 
| Paid hourly or hourly\-annual |  **Hourly** – Software is charged by the hour\. Each instance type can be priced differently \(but it isn't required to be\), and usage is rounded up to the nearest whole hour\.  **Hourly with Free Trial** – Customers are limited to running exactly one instance of the software without incurring a charge\. You define the duration, between 5 and 30 days\. The free trial applies to the most expensive instance type that is running, and any concurrent usage outside the 1 instance is billed at the hourly rate\. NOTE: This is a different model than the AWS Free Tier for Amazon EC2 usage whereby customers are given 750 hours of free usage each month\.  **Hourly and Monthly** – Both hourly and monthly charges are applied independently\. The monthly fee is charged every month regardless of usage, and the hourly fee is applied based on hourly usage only\.  **Hourly with Annual** – Customers have the option to purchase a year’s worth of usage upfront for one Amazon EC2 instance of one instance type\. You set the pricing for each instance type and can offer net savings over the hourly price\. Any customer usage above the number of annual subscriptions purchased is billed at the hourly rate you set for that instance type\.  **Hourly with Multi\-Annual and Custom Duration** – This type of offer is only available through seller private offers\. Using seller private offers, you specify a custom contract duration, up to 3 years\. You can specify upfront payment, or include a flexible payment schedule\. You set the pricing for each instance type\. If there is a flexible payment schedule in the offer, you also set the invoice dates, payment amounts, and number of instances for each instance type included in the offer\. For an active seller private offer with a flexible payment schedule, after the customer launches the specified number of instances, any additional instances launched are charged at the hourly rate specified in the seller private offer\. For more information about multi\-year and custom duration contracts, see [Private offers](private-offers-overview.md) and [Flexible payment scheduler](flexible-payment-scheduler.md)\. **Hourly with Annual \(includes Free Trial\)** – This is identical to the Hourly model with an Annual option, except it includes a Free Trial allowing a customer to run one instance of any instance type for free for a set number of days that you determine\. Annual subscriptions can be purchased at any time, and they are combined with the Free Trial subscription\.  **Annual with Hourly** – Same as the Hourly with Annual pricing model\. Customers have the option to purchase a year’s worth of usage upfront for one Amazon EC2 instance of one instance type\. You set the pricing for each instance type and can offer net savings over the hourly price, but offering savings isn't required\. Any customer usage above the number of annual subscriptions purchased is billed at the hourly rate you set for that instance type\.  **Multi\-Annual and Custom Duration with Hourly** – This is only available through [Private offers](private-offers-overview.md)\. Using seller private offers, you can specify a custom duration contract of up to three years\. You can require upfront payment, or you can offer a flexible payment schedule to the customer\. You set the pricing for each instance type for the duration of the contract, and the hourly pricing for additional instances launched\. If you offer a flexible payment schedule, you also set the invoice dates, payment amounts, and number of instances for each instance type included in the offer\. For an active private offer with a flexible payment schedule, after the specified number of instances have been launched, any additional instances the customer launches are charged at the hourly rate specified in the private offer\. For more information about multi\-year and custom duration contracts, see [Private offers](private-offers-overview.md) and [Flexible payment scheduler](flexible-payment-scheduler.md)\.  Free Trial and Annual pricing can't be combined with Monthly pricing\.   | 
| Paid monthly  |  **Monthly** – Software is paid for on a fixed monthly basis, regardless of the number of instances the customer runs\. Monthly charges are pro\-rated at sign\-up and upon cancellation\. Example: A customer who subscribes for 1 day of the month will be charged for 1/30th of the month\.  **Monthly with Hourly** – Both Hourly and Monthly charges are applied independently\. The monthly fee is charged every month regardless of usage, and the hourly fee is applied based on hourly usage only\.   Free Trial and Annual pricing can't be combined with Monthly pricing\.   | 
| Paid usage pricing |  Software is directly charged for the value you provide along with one of four usage categories: users, data, bandwidth, or hosts\. You can define up to 24 dimensions for the product\. All charges are still incurred hourly by the customer\.  All usage is calculated monthly and billed monthly using the same mechanism as existing AWS Marketplace software\. Usage pricing is also referred to as AWS Marketplace Metering Service\.   | 
|  Contract pricing model  |  **AMI with contract pricing** – A Single\-AMI product or Single\-AMI with AWS CloudFormation stack that the buyer pays an upfront fee for\.  | 

## AWS charges and software charges<a name="aws-charges-vs-software-charges"></a>

Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\)\-based product charges fall into two categories:
+ **Infrastructure Pricing Details** – All AMI\-based products incur associated AWS infrastructure charges depending on the services and infrastructure used\. These rates and fees are defined and controlled by AWS, and can vary between AWS Regions\. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/)\.
+ **Software Pricing Details** – For Paid products, the seller defines the charges for using the software\. 

These two product charge categories are displayed separately on the AWS Marketplace detail pages to help buyers understand the potential cost of using the products\. 

### Free trial for AMI hourly products<a name="free-trial"></a>

AMI hourly products are eligible for the optional Free trial program\. In a Free trial, a customer can subscribe to the product and use a single instance for up to 31 days without paying software charges on the product\. Applicable AWS infrastructure charges still apply\. Free trials will automatically convert to a paid subscription upon expiration\. Customers will be charged for additional usage above the free units provided\. To offer an hourly product free trial, define the duration of the trial period and notify the [AWS Marketplace Managed Catalog Operations \(MCO\)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/) team\. The trial period can be 5–31 days\.

When customers subscribe to a Free trial product, they receive a welcome email message that includes the term of the Free trial, a calculated expiration date, and details on unsubscribing\. A reminder email message is sent three days before the expiration date\.

If you offer a Free trial product in AWS Marketplace, you agree to the specific refund policies described under **Refund Policy**\.
