# Consulting partner setup of resell opportunities<a name="consulting-partner-info"></a>

To create a consulting partner private offer, you must be registered through the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management) as an AWS Marketplace seller\. The following topics can help you get started as an AWS Marketplace seller\.

## Putting an agreement in place with an ISV<a name="consulting-partner-isv-agreement"></a>

Before you as a consulting partner can create a private offer for a product, the ISV must authorize you to resell their product\. The ISV does this by creating an *opportunity* for you\. For more information, see [ISV setup of resell opportunities](consulting-partner-isv-info.md)\. To create an opportunity, the ISV must provide:
+ The product or products that they authorize you to resell\.
+ The price reduction that they want to offer you\.
+ The AWS account ID that you used to register as an AWS Marketplace seller\.

After the opportunity has been created, you will be an authorized reseller for that product\. Then, you can extend private offers that are marked up from the price given you by the ISV\.

## Extending a private offer based on an opportunity<a name="consulting-partner-recurring-discount"></a>

For recurring discount private offers, an ISV authorizes a consulting partner to resell one or more of their products on AWS Marketplace\. The discount, called the wholesale price, is an agreed\-to price or percentage discount off the product’s list price\. Consulting partners can use the discount with any number of buyers\.

The following procedure outlines how a consulting partner can extend a private offer based on a recurring discount\. 

**To extend a private offer based on a recurring discount**

1. Determine what your offer price will be by marking up the wholesale price by a percentage\.

1. Sign into the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/)\.

1. Choose **Partner** from the menu at the top of the screen\.

1. From the **Opportunities you received** list, choose the opportunity with the product and discount you want to offer to the buyer, and then select **Create Offer**\.

1. Step through the **Create Private Offer** screens, entering required information, including the buyer's account, the pricing details of the offer \(including the marked\-up price by a percentage\), the End User License Agreement \(EULA\), and the dates for the offer\. Then, choose **Review Offer**\.

1. Review the offer, and then choose **Extend Offer**\.

The publishing process for this offer can take up to 45 minutes to complete\. After it's completed, the offer is visible on the **Manage Offers** page\.

## Accepted offers<a name="consulting-partner-after-submitting-form"></a>

After the buyer accepts the private offer from the consulting partner, the offer and any disbursement of funds occur in the same manner:

1. AWS Marketplace invoices the buyer on their existing AWS bill per the terms of the private offer\. If the private offer is extended to a linked account, the invoiced amount appears on the payer account associated with that linked account\.

1. The buyer pays their AWS bill in accordance with the net payment terms that they agreed to with AWS\. The private offer process enables custom terms for each transaction, but net payment terms aren't customizable\. 

1. After AWS receives payment from the buyer, AWS disburses payment to you and the ISV\. The ISV receives the wholesale cost minus the AWS Marketplace fee\. You receive your markup minus the AWS Marketplace processing fee\. All fees are percentages applied to the transaction amounts listed\. If you're not sure of the fee percentages and need this information for quoting purposes, contact your AWS Marketplace channel account manager\. If you don’t know who that is, send an email message to the AWS Marketplace channel team at aws\-mp\-channel@amazon\.com, and someone on the team will respond to you within 24 hours\. 

1. AWS Marketplace provides electronic reports to the ISV and to you using the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management)\. These reports have the following differences depending on the type of private offer:
   + For recurring discount private offers, the ISV sees you as the buyer and you see the subscriber as the buyer\.
   + For non\-recurring discount private offers, the ISV and the consulting partner see the subscriber as the buyer\.
