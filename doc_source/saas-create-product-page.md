# Create an initial SaaS product page<a name="saas-create-product-page"></a>

Take your software as a service \(SaaS\) application metadata, and create a new SaaS product in AWS Marketplace catalog, using the AWS Marketplace Management Portal\.

1. Sign in to the [AWS Marketplace Management Portal](http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/homepage)\.

1. For **Products**, choose **SaaS**\.

1. For **Create SaaS product**, choose **SaaS Subscriptions** or **SaaS Contracts**,depending on the type of product you want to create, and then choose **Start**\.
**Note**  
If you choose **SaaS Contracts**, you will set a contract price, or a contract with pay\-as\-you\-go pricing when you set the pricing information for your product\.

1. Review and complete the product creation wizard using the metadata and product assets you gathered\. For assistance with creating your SaaS product, [contact the AWS Marketplace Operations team](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.

1. The AWS Marketplace Operations team publishes your product as a limited product that is visible to you and any AWS accounts you have allowed to view the product\. 
**Note**  
Prices can be temporarily reduced so that you can test the purchase flow without incurring high charges\. For more information, [contact us](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/management/contact-us/)\.

1. The AWS Marketplace Operations team sends an email message to the address associated with your AWS account to enable testing of product codes, Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) topics, and product page URLs\. This is the first of several tests for your product that are required before the product can go live\. You can respond to the email from the AWS Marketplace Operations team for support and requests about your product, for example, requesting that more accounts have access to the product for testing purposes\.
